#  👇 ℹ️ About me 👇
  Hi, my name is Martyna. In June 2022, I completed postgraduate studies as a Software tester for mobile and server applications at the WSB University in Toruń, which allowed me to learn about the duties and tasks of both a manual and an automation tester. I would like to connect my further career path with testing/quality assurance. Currently, I am educating myself in issues related to software testing. I recently passed a Become a Manual Tester course with Dare IT and now I am participating Challenge Dare IT - Automated Tests with Python what seemed to be next step in self-education as a tester, but under the supervision of qualified and motivating instructors. I have experience in working with people but also in individual tasks.
